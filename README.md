# Native framework for HiSilicon Kirin devices

## About

This repository aims to patch the AOSP framework instead of using binary files in order to support HiSilicon based smartphones.

At the moment it just supports Android 6.0 and Android 7.0

## Workflow

There will be an open issue and a Wiki page for every new service that's being worked on. The most critical services will have a higher priority.

## Contributions :beer:

Contributions are really appreciated but familiarity with C++ is required.

Logs and binaries are also helpful.
